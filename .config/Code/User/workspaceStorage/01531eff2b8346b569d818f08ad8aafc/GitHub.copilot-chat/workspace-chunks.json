Estas tramas se envían mediante **MQTT** a un servidor Mosquitto y posteriormente se almacenan en InfluxDB mediante un cliente Python. La información es procesada y organizada en **measurements** dentro de un **bucket** en InfluxDB.\n\nPara la visualización de los datos, utilizamos **Grafana**, donde se diseñarán dashboards personalizados para analizar el estado del vehículo en tiempo real.\n...\n````","range":{"startLineNumber":3,"startColumn":6,"endLineNumber":9,"endColumn":16},"embedding":[-0.0018615723,0.035064697,0.014678955,-0.048309326,0.0015563965,0.0033874512,-0.042755127,0.019195557,-0.03878784,-0.048431396,0.0020751953,0.017181396,-0.012268066,-0.12362671,0.056427002,0.06741333,-0.037506104,0.018859863,-0.020050049,0.12350464,0.03463745,0.022338867,0.056488037,0.020904541,-0.029174805,-0.022094727,-0.01373291,0.07055664,-0.0067443848,-0.05834961,0.016784668,-0.059387207,-0.003692627,-0.050842285,-0.017852783,-0.024505615,0.046875,-0.036987305,-0.041137695,0.014801025,0.024475098,-0.027954102,0.010498047,0.031036377,0.007965088,-0.092315674,-0.08114624,0.019348145,0.017791748,0.0713501,-0.0016174316,-0.037475586,0.029327393,0.09994507,0.046020508,0.011932373,-0.040618896,0.060577393,0.042999268,0.03640747,0.029266357,-0.027832031,0,0.047546387,0.008605957,-0.030944824,-0.019958496,-0.0038452148,0.0062561035,0.029693604,0.03866577,0.07107544,-0.06756592,-0.01586914,0.04663086,-0.046173096,-0.088012695,-0.012908936,-0.043701172,-0.02017212,-0.1003418,-0.011810303,-0.07269287,-0.09500122,-0.018798828,-0.055847168,-0.06448364,-0.03616333,-0.020751953,-0.024536133,-0.018463135,0.024719238,-0.08602905,0.008178711,0.062469482,-0.005340576,-0.017059326,-0.011810303,-0.033294678,0.018859863,0.103881836,-0.056732178,-0.0519104,-0.09738159,0.027252197,-0.046783447,0.06793213,0.018371582,0.01727295,0.0049438477,0.07485962,0.04559326,0.10058594,0.012237549,0.028289795,-0.010437012,-0.006958008,-0.05984497,-0.0026245117,-0.027191162,0.019805908,-0.009796143,-0.018127441,-0.013153076,-0.0044555664,-0.009124756,-0.031188965,0.0044555664,0.0025634766,-0.013549805,0.045532227,-0.04006958,0.0819397,-0.012023926,0.051635742,-0.051971436,-0.015625,-0.026763916,-0.027038574,0.008514404,0.018463135,-0.13293457,0.03387451,-0.0073242188,0.015594482,-0.006713867,0.0064697266,0.01977539,0.027679443,-0.046844482,0.037078857,0.009399414,-0.08807373,-0.015716553,0.023956299,0.04598999,0.0395813,-0.0062561035,-0.017700195,-0.041778564,-0.027801514,-0.033081055,0.01461792,-0.046813965,-0.03173828,0.015136719,0.036315918,-0.05368042,-0.083343506,0.031036377,0.034088135,-0.042114258,0.032165527,0.03289795,0.031097412,-0.049316406,-0.013885498,-0.08514404,0.049621582,0.0099487305,-0.04397583,0.00881958,-0.012969971,0.016845703,-0.052215576,-0.036224365,-0.0051574707,0.051971436,-0.015319824,0.001159668,-0.021514893,0.09033203,0.013122559,0.03945923,0.02798462,-0.08200073,0.015258789,0.014556885,-0.011962891,-0.00680542,-0.03567505,0.05859375,0.07962036,-0.029449463,0.04345703,-0.028808594,0.050750732,-0.037628174,0.034606934,-0.021362305,0.047180176,0.023864746,0.029174805,-0.021453857,-0.0814209,0.037506104,-0.10482788,0.023406982,-0.0042419434,-0.028411865,-0.026824951,0.05645752,0.009857178,-0.008728027,0.011688232,0.05508423,0.042388916,-0.09194946,-0.00048828125,0.03366089,0.009521484,0.008972168,-0.0019226074,-0.03765869,-0.012023926,-0.02243042,0.07287598,-0.02557373,-0.04827881,0.027496338,-0.009063721,-0.029510498,-0.013427734,0.022064209,-0.001739502,-0.000030517578,-0.07281494,-0.048675537,0.08230591,0.052734375,0.041259766,0.1105957,0.06222534,0.038909912,-0.00030517578,-0.06472778,-0.05227661,-0.048461914,0.0063171387,-0.066467285,0.033233643,0.038726807,-0.061706543,-0.021118164,0.022827148,-0.012481689,0.022857666,0.029541016,0.007019043,-0.030853271,0.11227417,0.00064086914,0.034332275,0.0040893555,0.0028686523,0.027038574,-0.013824463,-0.024047852,-0.006713867,0.033325195,-0.00048828125,-0.0831604,0.0016479492,0.10406494,0.01574707,0.035369873,0.08859253,-0.024047852,0.035461426,-0.035369873,0.059448242,0.044708252,-0.06515503,0.031158447,0.021392822,0.039367676,0.02658081,0.06188965,0.0065612793,0.053344727,0.07589722,0.039733887,-0.005432129,-0.01876831,-0.025543213,0.009460449,0.0574646,-0.0002746582,-0.018493652,-0.015197754,-0.08370972,-0.0340271,-0.05532837,0.0095825195,0.018951416,0.0036621094,0.035064697,0.0053710938,0.073394775,-0.03463745,0.014312744,-0.0063171387,0.00064086914,-0.056488037,0.0012512207,-0.11804199,0.049072266,0.037750244,0.023040771,0.018341064,0.0831604,-0.04220581,0.059448242,-0.0018005371,-0.006164551,0.00039672852,-0.064575195,0.018585205,-0.030975342,0.02798462,0.06277466,-0.030822754,-0.040649414,0.008453369,0.05883789,0.046905518,-0.0047912598,-0.051879883,0.014678955,0.015899658,0.008087158,0.025177002,0.0063171387,-0.098602295,0.0057678223,-0.023834229,0.054626465,0.057556152,-0.064971924,-0.012329102,-0.05886841,0.05822754,0.0043640137,-0.011505127,0.033813477,0.004180908,-0.022033691,-0.030090332,-0.057525635,-0.0927124,0.072753906,-0.03869629,-0.05456543,-0.0395813,-0.0009460449,0.0005187988,-0.0101623535,0.049713135,-0.006439209,0.012969971,0.06561279,0.049957275,-0.060180664,-0.015411377,-0.00076293945,-0.01159668,-0.0010986328,0.049835205,-0.016143799,0.0524292,-0.014007568,-0.056671143,0.002166748,-0.010467529,-0.0036010742,0.06390381,0.07531738,-0.005

`esp32-can-monitor/include/README`\n````UNKNOWN\n\nThis directory is intended for project header files.\n\nA header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions\nto be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a\nheader file in your project source file (C, C++, etc) located in `src` folder\nby including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include'.\n\n```src/main.c\n\n#include \"header.h\"\n\nint main (void)\n{\n ...\n}\n```\n\nIncluding a header file produces the same results as copying the header file\ninto each source file that needs it. Such copying would be time-consuming\nand error-prone. With a header file, the related declarations appear\nin only one place. If they need to be changed, they can be changed in one\nplace, and programs that include the header file will automatically use the\nnew version when next recompiled. The header file eliminates the labor of\nfinding and changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to\nfind one copy will result in inconsistencies within a program.\n\nIn C, the convention is to give header files names that end with
